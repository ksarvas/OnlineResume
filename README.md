## Comments for Reviewer

* I mostly wanted to make a Responsive Online Resume with a very different format from the original. I plan on adjusting some of the styling, colors, adding icons, and even adding skill progress bars as I continue along with the Nanodegree. Please let me know if you have any suggestions regarding this or just in general.

* I wanted to change the "welcomeMessage" into an About Me section instead, so I changed that a bit. I know the rubric stated to match the schema exactly, but I was hoping this change was acceptable?

* I also don't have any double majors, so I turned "majors" into "major" with a singular string value instead of an array or strings.

* I wasn't quite sure how to append the URLs to the HREF of the 'a' tags, but that is something I would like to tackle at some point as I continue along with the Nanodegree.

* Thank you for your time!

## Known Issues

* The 'a' tags are currently too wide. The clickable area isn't restricted to just the visible text area. My plan is to either turn all of these 'a' tags into 'h5' tags since they currently don't link to anything, or get the URLs to replace the HREF value and then adjust the sizing/dispay properties after that.
